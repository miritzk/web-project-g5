                        <p>During the Corona period, the studio's training was transferred to an online format, via Zoom. <br>
                            For your convenience, I have decided to upload a number of selected workouts to the site, so that you can
                            train independently when you can not get to the studio.

                            <h3>Classical Pilates</h3>
                            <p>Classical Pilates incorporates both mat and apparatus work. Classical has a traditional order, which
                                includes transitions between exercises, that makes this type of Pilates good for practitioners who thrive on
                                structure and predictability in their workouts.
                                Another important distinction between classical Pilates and other types is the resting position. Classical
                                Pilates focuses on more of a posterior pelvic tilt (hips tilt toward your back), as well as a few other
                                postural preferences at the head, neck and shoulders.</p>

                            <h3>Mat Pilates</h3>
                            <p>The exercises in mat Pilates are performed with your body and a yoga mat in lieu of machines and equipment.
                                Mat Pilates focuses on your core, making it beneficial for those with back pain. The movements in mat
                                Pilates are based on the mat exercises in the classical Pilates system.</p>

                            <h3>Reformer Pilates</h3>
                            <p>This type of Pilates offers similar core-strengthening benefits of mat Pilates, but uses a reformer, a
                                machine with a bed-like frame, a platform and a set of springs. Many of the exercises on the reformer are
                                the same as mat exercises but performed with the added resistance of the reformer's springs, straps and
                                ropes.
                                Ultimately, you can better customize fitness goals such as improving postural alignment and coordination
                                than you can with mat Pilates. Since reformer Pilates classes tend to be more intense than mat classes, they
                                might be the better choice for those already well-versed in mat Pilates and are looking to burn more
                                calories and lose weight.</p>

                            <h3>Prenatal Pilates</h3>
                            <p>Aside from being low-impact and keeping your heart rate steady, Pilates is also considered a great choice
                                for pregnant women because its exercises can be adapted to suit you as you progress through the different
                                stages
                                of pregnancy. Inversions, for instance, can be a no-go for women in their first trimester because of
                                feelings of
                                dizziness. But a good pregnancy class should avoid these, or offer modifications when it comes to any
                                inversion
                                exercises.</p>
